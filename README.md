# CSS-Transform-Transition-and-Animations-Oh-My
Full Stack Development Animations Lab 3.3.1


Activity: Transform, Transition, and Animations, Oh My!
Let's build out some simple animations to help make our webpages stand out!

We'll start with given starter code. Please note when you clone the following repository, there are three different nested folders: transition-activity, transform-activity, and animation-activity. Each one corresponds to a section below, starting with the transition activity.

Setup
Instructions:
Click HERE for the link to the repo.
Fork (not clone) it to your OWN GitHub account.
Now to clone the repo to your machine, click the green 'Code' button and then copy the URL.
In a new terminal, or Git Bash, go to where you want to clone the repo.
Type "git clone" in the terminal or Git Bash, then a space, then paste the URL you copied from your repo. Example:

Click here to copy
Hit "Enter" or "Return" whichever is on your keyboard.
Do the assignment in Visual Studio Code and stage your changes using git add -A command.
Make at least one commit by using git commit -m "write your message here" command. Example:

Click here to copy
Finally push your changes using the git push command. Example:

Transform
Let's start with the transform-activity first. Your goal is to make the Tilted Designs webpage look like the screenshot below.


Navigate to the transform-activity folder and open the activity.css and index.html files in your code editor.
Open the index.html in your browser as well.
Add a transform rule to the main element in the CSS to achieve the look given above.
Stuck? Take a look at the possible transform values and find what would be most appropriate to use.
Note: Browser width and height will alter the appearance of this design. Try to make it look good around a medium browser width. Don't stress about making this work for every browser size. Close enough is good enough!
Transition
Let's move onto the transition-activity. Your goal is to style the button as shown in the gif below.


Navigate to the transition-activity folder and open the activity.css and index.html files in your code editor.
Open the index.html in your browser as well.
Use ghostwhite as the background color for the button's beginning state.
Use cornflowerblue as the background color for the button's hover state.
Use the transition property to make that color change transition happen over 2 seconds when hovering over the button.
Note how the text color changes as well! Don't forget to account for that in your styling.
Animation and Keyframes
Finally, let's move onto the animation-activity. Your goal here is to make a hamburger menu icon that changes to an X on hover.


Navigate to the animation-activity folder and open the activity.css and index.html files in your code editor.
Open the index.html in your browser as well.
This one may be tough! Try and think up a plan while taking into consideration the following points:
The middle line div needs to 'disappear'.
The bottom line div needs to 'rotate' so that it goes from bottom left to top right.
The top line div needs to 'rotate' so that it goes top left to bottom right.
Stuck? Don't forget you can use transforms in keyframe animations as well!
Acceptance Criteria
When opening the transform-activity index.html in the browser, the main content within and including the colored box should be skewed.
When opening the transition-activity index.html in the browser and hovering over the 'I want to go there!' button, the color change should be smooth instead of instant.
When opening the animation-activity index.html in the browser and hovering over the three lines within the colored box, the lines should change into an 'X'.

Before submitting, make sure you do a self review of your code, check for formatting, spelling, include comments in your code, and ensure you have a healthy commit history.

Make sure to submit your github repository link on the submission page.

Bonus: More Transitions
If you've finished all of the above, here's a fun transition bonus to try. Make it so that when hovering over the image, the caption title and text overlays the image as shown below.


Navigate back to the transition-activity folder and open the activity.css and index.html files in your code editor.
Open the index.html in your browser as well.
Feel free to change up as much code in the CSS and HTML as you need to achieve the above effect.
